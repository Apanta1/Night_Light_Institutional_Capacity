<h1>Research Abstract</h1>

In my research, I am interested in empirically analyzing the impact of three key potential determinants of economic growth---institutional capacity, educational outcomes, and political leadership&mdash;from 2017 to 2021.

In an institutional capacity, I refer to the ability of municipalities to execute their responsibilities reflected through their day-to-day performance and overall accomplishments. I am curious whether stronger institutional capacity is related to better economic growth or not. After preliminary findings, I am microscopically analyzing the most significant aspect of institutional capacity&mdash;intergovernmental co-ordination and cooperation.

In terms of educational outcomes, I am focusing on the percentage of the population with a high school degree or above. There is a plethora of literature that affirms that higher educational attainment among the population yields higher economic growth. I am eager to see if the conclusion holds true in the context of the municipalities of Nepal. 

In the case of political leadership, I am specifically looking at quantifiable aspects of chairpersons of municipality, like their sex, age at election, and political affiliation. These three variables provide a foundation for analyzing the difference in the performance of male and female leaders, the impact of age on economic growth, and the performance of chairpersons belonging to the ruling party in the federal government.

This repository consists the datasets I am working with, stata code I am using for empirical analysis and research report alongside other essential documents of this research.
